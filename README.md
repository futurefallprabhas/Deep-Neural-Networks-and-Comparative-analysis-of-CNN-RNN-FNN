# Deep Learning Model Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various deep learning models as part of a project focusing on applying methodologies from selected research papers. The project is divided into two main parts: the implementation of a chosen paper and practical applications of different neural network architectures.

## Project Structure

- **Part 2A**: Implementation of a selected research paper.
- **Part 2B**: Implementation of key neural network architectures, including:
  - Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision
```
